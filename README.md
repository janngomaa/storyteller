This small app involves creating a Streamlit app that generates stories and converts them into audio using OpenAI and ElevenLabs APIs.
To follow this tutorial you'll need to follow a series of steps. This guide assumes you're a beginner and breaks down the process into detailed steps, from setting up your environment to running the app.

To reproduce and follow the code example you've provided, which involves creating a Streamlit app that generates stories and converts them into audio using OpenAI and ElevenLabs APIs, you'll need to follow a series of steps. This guide assumes you're a beginner and breaks down the process into detailed steps, from setting up your environment to running the app.

### Step 1: Setup Your Development Environment
Install Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. The app requires Python, so if you haven't installed it yet, download and install it from python.org.

Create a Project Directory: Create a folder on your computer where you will store your project files.

Open Terminal or Command Prompt: Navigate to your project directory using the terminal (Mac/Linux) or command prompt (Windows).

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
In your terminal, navigate to your project directory.
Run python3 -m venv env on Mac/Linux or python -m venv env on Windows to create a virtual environment named env.
Activate the virtual environment by running source env/bin/activate on Mac/Linux or .\env\Scripts\activate on Windows.
### Step 3: Install Required Packages
With your virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages by running:
bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit dotenv langchain-openai elevenlabs
This command installs Streamlit for creating the web app, dotenv for managing environment variables, langchain-openai for generating stories using OpenAI, and elevenlabs for converting text to speech.

### Step 4: Prepare Your Code
Using a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like Visual Studio Code, create a new file named app.py in your project directory.
Copy and paste the code you provided into app.py.
### Step 5: Setup Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in your project directory.
Add your OpenAI API key, ElevenLabs API key, model names, and any other configurations your code requires. For example:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=1
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
ELEVENLABS_MODEL_NAME=eleven_multilingual_v2
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_NAME=Rachel
```
Replace placeholder values with your actual API keys and model names.

### Step 6: Run Your Streamlit App
In your terminal, with the virtual environment activated and within your project directory, start the Streamlit app by running:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Streamlit will start the server, and you should see a message with a URL, usually http://localhost:8501, which you can open in your web browser to view your app.
### Step 7: Use the App
Once the app is running in your browser, you can enter your draft story scenario and click a button or input field (as designed in your app) to generate the story and its audio version.
The app will require you to input your OpenAI API key and ElevenLabs API key directly into the Streamlit interface unless already configured in your .env file and picked up by the app.
Troubleshooting Tips
Ensure your API keys are correctly entered and valid.
Check the console for any errors if the app doesn't work as expected. The error messages can guide you on what went wrong.
Make sure all environment variables are correctly named and matched in your code.
### Conclusion
Following these steps, you should be able to set up, run, and interact with your Streamlit app that utilizes OpenAI and ElevenLabs APIs for generating stories and their audio versions. This project is a great way to learn about APIs, Python programming, and creating interactive web apps with Streamlit.
